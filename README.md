A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal. Simplistically, an individual is given the challenge of starting a path at one entrance and find one exit without crossing any walls or barriers. There are several different possibilities for maze challenges, but the most simple ones have one entrance and one exit.

There are several algorithms that facilitate the creation of mazes. For this assignment, however, we will work with mazes that are already created. For all these mazes, the entrance is in position (0,0) and the exit is in position (rows, columns), depending on the number of rows and columns in the maze. Mazes are designed to have a zero (0) when the path is clear and one (1) when the path contains a wall.
